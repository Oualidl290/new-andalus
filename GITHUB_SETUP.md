   echo "# Test" > test.md
   git add test.md
   git commit -m "test: verify GitHub setup"
   git push origin test/github-setup
   ```

2. **Create a Pull Request:**

## 🎯 Step 9: Release Process Setup

### Create First Release
1. **Tag a release:**
   ```bash
   git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Initial release"
   git push origin v1.0.0
   ```

2. **Verify release workflow:**
   - GitHub release created automatically
   - Docker images built and pushed
   - Security scans completed

### Semantic Versioning
- **v1.0.0** - Major release
- **v1.1.0** - Minor release (new features)
- **v1.1.1** - Patch release (bug fixes)
- **v1.1.0-beta.1** - Pre-release

## 📈 Step 10: Monitoring and Analytics

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Status checks not appearing:**

npx @github/workflow-validator .github/workflows/*.yml
```

**Branch protection not working:**
